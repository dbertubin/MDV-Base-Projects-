					The Food

				<p>
					Colombian food is by far my favorite of Latin Cuisine. So with that being said this may be bias, but definitely will be the most favorite to speak about the culture. There are a fairly large variety of dishes that correspond to the different regional climates. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On of my favorite dished is from Medellín  and is called bandeja paisa or Paisa platter.  A typical bandeja paisa will have red beans, rice, carne asada, chorizo, fried egg, arepa and chicharrón. You will also commonly see it accompanied by avocado and or tomatoes. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Another Colombian favorite is sancocho or sancocho de gallina. It is the most traditional of dishes in Cali. And is made primarily of chicken, corn, yucca, various seasoning and coriander.
