				<p>
					Colombia has a unique advantage because there are five solid commercial hubs within the country: Bogota, Medellin, Barranquilla, Cali, and Cartagena. This is a strong advantage compared to the majority of Latin American countries that have one or two major cities. For U.S exporters this means access via multiple commercial hubs. It is also convenient since each of these hubs has its own American Chamber of Commerce. This means many opportunities for Americans in Colombia. Below you will find useful things to know when doing business with Colombians.
