				<p>
					Colombia has a unique advantage because there are five solid commercial hubs within the country: Bogota, Medellin, Barranquilla, Cali, and Cartagena. This is a strong advantage compared to the majority of Latin American countries that have one or two major cities. For U.S exporters this means access via multiple commercial hubs. It is also convenient since each of these hubs has its own American Chamber of Commerce. This means many opportunities for Americans in Colombia. Below you will find useful things to know when doing business with Colombians.

				<h4>
					Working Practices 
				</h4>	
					<ul>
						<li>
							For most of Colombian cities the workday starts and 9 a.m. and lasts until 5 p.m. and may on some occasions extend until 7 p.m. Monday though Friday is the standard workweek. Weekends are typically for family and thus business is rarely ever conducted. 
						</li>
						<li>
							It is ideal to schedule business appointments far in advance. At least two to three weeks is good. You may also want to give yourself a few hours in between if you are scheduling more than one meeting in a day in case a meeting should go over the expected time. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Also, you may want to keep in mind that business lunches are highly favored as a way of conducting business and don’t be surprise if they go on for many hours. So have a light snack before and leave room for some wonderful food!
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>	
				<div>
				<h4>
					Structure within Colombian Companies  
				</h4>	
					<ul>
						<li>
							Colombian companies usually have hierarchies that are vertical. This is an important part of the business culture and strongly suggested that it is respected as much as possible.
						</li>
						<li>
							Senior members of staff usually make most decisions, yet it is not uncommon though to seek opinions and consensus from subordinate employees. 
						</li>
						<li>
							It is highly advisable that titles are used. This shows respect to those with authority, especially to the elder and more senior members of the group.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>	
				<div>
				<h4>
					Working relationships in Colombia  
				</h4>	
					<ul>
						<li>
							For a successful working environment, building trust and cultivating a close personal relationship are considered vital components.						
						</li>
						<li>
							It is in the same mindset that you will find many family members working within the same business; Colombians prefer to do business with those who they know and trust. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
				<h4>
					Colombian business practices    
				</h4>	
					<ul>
						<li>
							In line with social cultural grammar, handshakes are the most common form of greeting, although people who are familiar and know each other well may greet each other with embrace. Offering your hand upon arrival as well as departure is an essential part of Colombian culture.				
						</li>
						<li>
							Once again, courtesy titles such as “Mr” (Señor), “Mrs” (Señora), or “Miss” (Señorita), and professional titles (i.e. “Licenciado”, “Doctor”, “Profesor”) should be used as much as possible, followed by a last name. Only use first names when invited to do so. 						
						</li>
						<li>
							Colombian business culture often has a flexible attitude towards time and this can result in rather lengthy business negotiations. Take your time; it will not be to your advantage to rush things. Instead, continue to build a relationship and gain trust.  						
						</li>
					</ul>
