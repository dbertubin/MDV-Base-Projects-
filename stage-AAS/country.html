					In Latin America, Colombia is the third most populous country. Most of the population is in the northern and western parts of the country. The Ethnic and cultural diversity in Colombia is comprised of indigenous, European (mainly Spanish), and African heritages. Only about 3% of the population consider themselves indigenous. Interestingly the indigenous and Afro-Colombians groups have faced challenges integrating into the mainstream Colombian Society.

					A little more than 1/3 of Colombians live in poverty. The country still faces despair as far as income and is subject to inadequate social services. The history, which has form the current reputation of the country, including years of violence involving outlaws and drug cartels together with a number of human rights violations, has gotten in the way of the attempts to address these problems by advancement of government social programs. Despite these setbacks, Colombia still makes progress, improving the security of its citizens, which is an essential in building stability and democracy.

					Colombia has a unique advantage because there are five solid commercial hubs within the country: Bogota, Medellin, Barranquilla, Cali, and Cartagena. This is a strong advantage compared to the majority of Latin American countries that have one or two major cities. For U.S exporters this means access via multiple commercial hubs. It is also convenient since each of these hubs has its own American Chamber of Commerce. This means many opportunities for Americans in Colombia. Below you will find useful things to know when doing business with Colombians.

					Regarding foreign direct investment, coal mining and oil and gas exploration/production are the principal areas of U.S. investment, followed by the consumer goods, high tech and tourism/franchising sectors. A sample of the major U.S. companies in Colombia include: Drummond, Chicago Bridge and Iron, General Electric, General Motors, Occidental Petroleum, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, Microsoft, Unisys, Kimberly Clark, Johnson and Johnson, Goodyear, Kraft, 3M, Marriott, and Sonesta Collection Hotels.
