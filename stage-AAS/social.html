				<p>
					In Colombia you will meet rich and passionate people just as you might find in the United States. There are a lot of similarities to the American culture as well as many differences.  I will out line a few of the common things to take note of when interacting with dynamically beautiful society.

				<h4>
					Greetings
				</h4>	
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h5>Men greeting Men:</h5>
							In the initial meeting, men will generally shake hands firmly when greeting one another. It is very important to maintain direct eye contact. For friends and family members, a light hug or embrace is normal. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Women greeting Women:</h5> 
							Generally in a business environment and usually when it is the very first time they meet, women greet with a soft handshake. Otherwise, if they are comfortable with each other, they might give one kiss on the cheek. With friends and family, a kiss on the cheek is almost expected.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Greetings between Men and Women: </h5>
							A handshake is the standard when you initially meet someone of the opposite sex, especially in a business or working environment. Yet, a large amount of people, both men and women, will greet with a single kiss on the cheek.  Greeting coworkers and people that you see every day, you are not expected to shake hands or kiss, at that point you would just greet them collectively saying “Hi, how are you?” and do not go around to each desk to kiss of shake hands as you may do in the United States. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h4>
					In respects to time
				</h4>	
					<ul>
							For most social situations extreme punctuality is not expected, even though it may be valued. It typically is not viewed as being rude to be late, especially if “late” is not longer that 30 -45 minutes. “Good” excuses though, are appreciated.
						</br>
						</br>
							Communication is a good idea if you know you will be late. This is especially true if the person you are meeting is very important to you or higher ranking. On the other hand when the person you will meet is lower ranking, it’s normal not to worry about making a person wait for you.
