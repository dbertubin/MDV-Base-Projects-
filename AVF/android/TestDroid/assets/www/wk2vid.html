                        What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with   jQuery, for instance)
                    </h5>
                    
                    There were a lot of things that I found in the HTML and XHTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0 Guide  http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20120103/html.html such as:
                    Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource,  where the objective is to avoid duplications occurs when adjacent text and iconic versions of a link are contained in a document.
                    Creating a logical tab order through links, form controls, and objects, this would provide a logical tab order when the default order does not suffice.
                    There are simple things like:
                    Providing a title by using the title element
                    Using alt attributes on images used as submit buttons
                    
                    <h5>
                        Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?
                    </h5>
                    
                    What I saw in the video was very frustration to even listen to. There are built-in screen readers, but they are repetitious and time-consuming. To answer the question how can I fix them, and if I'm understanding the question correctly, it would mean that I would need to use more of the excellent accessibility standards that have been approved by the W3.org
                    
                    <h5>
                        Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.
                    </h5>
                    
                    I don't know if I'm able to find devices specifically made to support accessibility, but I do notice that there are devices that have accessibility support. The iPhone and the iPad both have voiceover support, large text, Zoom, white on black, speech on selection, and speak autotext available for the vision impaired. For the hearing impaired there are custom vibrations as well as LED flash for alerts along with mono audio.
                    
                    <h5>
                        Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility
                    </h5>
