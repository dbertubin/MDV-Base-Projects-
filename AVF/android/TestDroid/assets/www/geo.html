                    <h5>
                        What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?
                    </h5>
                    Accelerometer, Camera, Compass, Contacts, File, Geolocation, Media, Network, Notification (Alert), Notification (Sound), Notification (Vibration) and Storage.
                    <h5>
                        For your CRUD app revision and/or Demo App components, which of these do you think you will implement?
                    </h5>
                    I would like to use Accelerometer, Camera, Compass, Contacts, Geolocation, and Notifications.
                    <h5>
                        Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.
                    </h5>
                    Taking the time to think out and wire frame what you want to do saves time coding. Also using tools like App Cooker and Balsamiq can help with all of the above. Think before you Do!
                    <h5>
                        Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.
                    </h5>
                    I would like everything to be congruent and to refine the usability of the two.
                    <h5>
                        If not covered above, please also describe any functionality intentions you may have for both the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.
                    </h5>
                    I would like to have everything integreated in to one app almost all of what we will do with the demo app are needed to build the full functionality of my app. I would like the user to add things that they want to do, drip pins or show where they want to do said thing. Send an invitation to friends from contacts about said thing, and use Notification as reminders deadline or dates.
