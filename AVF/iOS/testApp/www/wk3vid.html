                        <h5>
                           What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?
                        </h5>
                        Currently the top selling categories in the US are:
                        </br>
                        Paid and Free
                        </br>
                        Games
                        Utilities 
                        Social Networking apps
                        <h5>
                            Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?
                        </h5>
                        
                        What I saw in the video was very frustration to even listen to. There are built-in screen readers, but they are repetitious and time-consuming. To answer the question how can I fix them, and if I'm understanding the question correctly, it would mean that I would need to use more of the excellent accessibility standards that have been approved by the W3.org
                        
                        <h5>
                            Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.
                        </h5>
                        
                        I don't know if I'm able to find devices specifically made to support accessibility, but I do notice that there are devices that have accessibility support. The iPhone and the iPad both have voiceover support, large text, Zoom, white on black, speech on selection, and speak autotext available for the vision impaired. For the hearing impaired there are custom vibrations as well as LED flash for alerts along with mono audio.
                        
                        <h5>
                            Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility
